    <p>
      "<b><span style="font-size: 3.5vw; color: aqua;">Hi, I'm Shatodru</span></b>, the mind behind this blog. While it may be categorized as a mental health blog, 
      I envision it as a <span style="font-size: 3vw; color: #5a189a; font-weight: 600;">collection of stories</span> - <span style="font-size: 3.2vw; color: #ff7900;">yours and mine</span>. 
      I believe that acknowledging pain is the first step towards healing it. In creating this space, I don't position myself as an expert or guru; rather, 
      I see myself as a fellow human seeking more of the wanted and less of the unwanted in life. This blog aims not only to <span style="font-size: 3vw; color: #fcf300;">foster conversations</span> 
      between us 
      but also 
      in the process of it, a conversation between you and yourself, with all of us serving as translators of it. While I, like many, experience moments of pain, 
      I recognize that avoiding it only perpetuates its hold over us. Emotions, both positive and negative, deserve to be acknowledged and felt. 
      True liberation comes from embracing them fully. It may sound like a tired old saying, but giving it a real shot might send shivers down your spine initially. However, if you stick with it, 
      you'll find freedom arriving sooner than anticipated. This ethos underpins the essence of this blog, and 
      I hope it resonates with you as much as it does with me. Together, let's embrace our emotions and journey towards <span style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 3vw; color: #89023e;">self-discovery</span>."

        Understanding
      </h2>
      <p>
        Receiving a straightforward diagnosis can cause not only pain but also profound discomfort. A diagnosis often merely identifies a 
        problem without providing a comprehensive understanding. What exacerbates this situation is the existence of a lucrative industry that relies 
        on treating these issues with external substances, rather than addressing them through understanding and communication. Many of our perceived 
        "problems" may not require fixing; instead, they are unresolved aspects of ourselves. These aspects serve their 
        purpose in their own unique way and cannot be blamed. 
        Throughout our journey, we aim to delve deeper into these concepts for a better understanding.
